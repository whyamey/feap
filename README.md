# Fuzzy Extractors are Practical

Fuzzy key derivation system for irises with 91% TAR for 105 bits of entropy. This repo contains other repositories that form the parts
of our project. This repo only contains the V2 feature extractor.

**Note:** This repository will be submodules once the paper is past the review process. 

## Params
The only exception to the above point is the params directory, which contains the input-selection for `lsh-lock` and the zip file cotanining
subsets that were evaluated for performance. These files need to be uncompressed. They were compressed only to get around github's upload limit.
